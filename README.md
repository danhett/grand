## About
This is an interactive fiction experiment exploring the same space from multiple perspectives, written as part of my ongoing MA study at the Manchester Writing School. 

The Grand is a fictional art deco seaside hotel. It means many things to many people. This short interactive work allows you to explore the hotel and it's inhabitants from the perspectives of:
- Henry (a journalist covering the hotel opening, 1937)
- Ruby (attending a wedding in the hotel as a teenager, 1991)
- Yusuf (an incoming refugee housed in the hotel, 2022)

At any point you can switch character perspective to re-examine the space through different eyes. Your location in the physical space will stay the same, but your viewpoint and chronological point will change. 

This experience is open-ended and has no finishing point. Explore and read freely. 

## Try it out
The live project runs here: https://danhett.github.io/grand/

## Technical info
Built using Inkle's excellent Ink platform. To run this locally you'll need to spin up a server, as I've used iframes to display the interative content and switch between contexts. The code is very messy, but this project isn't about the code, really.
