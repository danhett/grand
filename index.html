        <p>This is a rough demo prototype of my current MA project, <i>The Grand</i>.</p>
        <p>This is a work of experimental interactive fiction, designed to allow player/readers to navigate the physical space of The Grand hotel, from several different perspectives. The player/reader can switch viewpoint at any time, inhabiting the same rooms and locations at different chronological points, from different viewpoints, and in different contexts.</p>
        <p>The Grand changes as much as it's inhabitants do. This project aims to explore this idea.</p>
